clamav-unofficial-sigs (5.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

 Clamav-unofficial-sigs maintenance was picked up by extremeshok,
 who contributed quite some cleanup to the scripts.

 The configuration file structure has changed, I adapted the
 changes to upstream. The old /etc/clamav-unofficial-sigs.conf.d
 directory is obsolete. Also shell code isn't evaluated by
 /usr/sbin/clamav-unofficial-sigs anymore, and thus one can not
 put more complex shell code into the configuration files anymore.

 There are now three configuration files in
 /etc/clamav-unofficial-sigs/, a 'master.conf' for default settings
 from upstream, an 'os.conf' for distribution specific defaults and
 a 'user.conf' for local changes.

 Changing the log file location does not work well, so log files
 are moved to /var/log/clamav-unofficial-sigs/ on package upgrade.

 The location of the single database storage has changed to match
 the ones upstream, no need to alter the configuration here.

 clamav-unofficial-sigs now reloads ClamAV signatures by default.

clamav-unofficial-sigs (3.7.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  This release reverts back to the upstream default of not checking
  if the clamav daemon is running. This allows the script to run
  on systems that don't run the daemon. If you want to re-enable the
  watchdog functionality, copy these two lines to your config file:

  clamd_socket="/var/run/clamav/clamd.ctl"
  clamd_pid="/var/run/clamav/clamd.pid"

clamav-unofficial-sigs (3.5.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  This version removes all the medium and high risk databases from
  the default configuration, if you would like to keep using them
  then please edit your configuration file as directed in it.

  This version switches to running the script as the clamav user
  instead of root to enhance security. If you wish to further
  increase security, please see README.Debian for a technique
  for running the script as a user separate to clamav.

  As a consequence of running the script as the clamav user,
  the package will no longer start clamav when it is not running.
